# 💐 I Have Something - Valentine's Flower Animation

A romantic, animated flower webpage built with pure HTML, CSS (SCSS), and JavaScript. This project creates a beautiful, animated flower garden with a night sky background, perfect for sharing a special Valentine's Day message.

## ✨ Features

- **Landing Page** (`index.html`) — Displays the text "I Have Something" with a subtle letter-by-letter animation and a button to open the flower display.
- **Flower Animation Page** (`flower.html`) — Animated 3D flowers with blooming petals, swaying stalks, grass, and glowing light particles, all built with pure CSS.
- **Typing Effect** — Messages are revealed letter-by-letter with a smooth typing animation.
- **Responsive Design** — Optimized for mobile and desktop viewing.
- **No External Dependencies** — Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No libraries or frameworks required.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** — Page structure
- **CSS3 / SCSS** — Flower animations, gradients, and responsive layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — Typing effect, DOM manipulation, localStorage handling

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing the Message

Edit `js/main.js` to modify the animated text on the flower page (default: `"wuwuvyang ❤️"`):

```javascript
const titles = "Your Message Here ❤️".split('');
```

Edit `js/index.js` to change the landing page text (default: `"I Have Something"`):

```javascript
const text = 'Your Text Here'.split('');
```

### Modifying Flower Colors

Flower colors are controlled via CSS variables and gradients in `scss/style.scss`. Look for:

- `background-color: #a7ffee` (petal color)
- `background-color: #6bf0ff` (petal glow)
- `#159faa`, `#39c6d6`, `#079097` (stem and leaf colors)
